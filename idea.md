## Game Description
We created a game based on the very popular mobile game, Flappy Bird, but specially adapted for our university.

This game is specifically designed to guide players (students) through a series of challenges.
Each obstacle encountered in the game is a representation of the course offered at the FAI. Reflecting the rigorous academic
environment of our institution, the game gradually increaces it's tempo, thus ensuring that only the most patient students can succeed.

There are set obstacles that players must overcome in order finish an entire degree program. However, the game has no end,
which might also represent student's feeling during his studies, when it feels like the school never ends.

The main objective of this game is to introduce future students to the credit system and curriculum
at our school in a fun and informative way, so that they can prepare for their academic journey ahead.

Our game will have a very simple, clean, pixel-art-like design which will not distract players
from collecting credits during their journey.
