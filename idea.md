## Game Description
We created a game based on the very popular mobile game, Flappy Bird, but specially adapted for our university.
This game is specifically designed to guide players—potentially students—through a series of challenges.
Each obstacle encountered in the game is a symbol of the unique approach offered at the FAI. Reflecting the rigorous academic
environment of our institution, the game develops incrementally, thus ensuring that only the most patient athletes can succeed.
There are set obstacles that participants must overcome in order to appear to have completed an entire degree program.
The main objective of this game is to introduce future students to the credit system and curriculum at our school in a fun and informative way,
so that they can prepare for their academic journey ahead.
